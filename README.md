# Accountability

This is the source code of the large group project for COP 4331C (Processes for Object-Oriented Software Development) at the University of Central Florida. This project contains both a web application and a native mobile (android) application.

"Accountability" helps you properly split up costs on the trips you take. It allows you to create trips, invite friends to your trip, add expenses scoped to the friends who were involved, and properly split up said expenses.
